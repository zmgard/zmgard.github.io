<section class="project">
  <h2>Econometric Panel Data Analysis – Wage Determinants</h2>
  <p class="project-role">Role: Data Analyst / Econometrics Lab</p>

  <p>
    A class project at the University of Oklahoma where we were tasked with selecting a dataset and conducting
    a study to determine what factors affect individual wages over time. I used <strong>R</strong> and
    libraries including <strong>tidyverse</strong>, <strong>plm</strong>, and <strong>estimatr</strong> to
    clean the data, calculate within-person variance, and run Pooled OLS, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects regression models.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Explored within-person variance for education, marital status, union membership, and rural residence</li>
    <li>Compared fixed effects, random effects, and pooled OLS estimates to analyze panel data</li>
    <li>Interpreted coefficients to understand wage impacts of union membership and other demographic factors</li>
    <li>Produced clear, reproducible results suitable for academic reporting</li>
  </ul>
